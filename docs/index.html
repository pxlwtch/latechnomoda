I enjoy being creative, programming üíª, and hanging out with my puppy, Moose üê∂. <br/> <br/> My design days begin in the age of MySpace‚Äî editing images and making MySpace Layouts. (NPR interview) My skills then made the transition to tumblr, where I would make gifs and tumblr themes. <br/> <br/> Eventually I saw an opportunity in the following that I had on my blog. I had been making jewelry and posting about it, and many of my followers urged me to sell my pieces on Etsy. It didn't take much to convice me, after some research and product testing, I began making pins inspired by some of my favorite bands and selling them on Etsy. To my surprise, they sold quite well. Soon, I realized I could be making more money by having a website outside of Etsy. That led to me making Bandshite.com, an online shop I managed along with a few employees, which was great, but as all good things must come to an end‚Äî that chapter of my life ended. <br/> <br/> In 2014, I began to work as a full time graphic designer for a company named Beverly Furniture. During this time, I went back to school to finish my degree in Communication Studies. In school, I focused on the interaction of humans and technology, and set my career aspirations in the tech world. I moved to the Bay Area in 2016, and completed a bootcamp to learn coding. <br/> <br/> Most recently, I have been working as a design consultant and have partnered up with small businesses and non-profits. In my free time, I like to make <a href=https://twitter.com/ihdalia/status/928025980056121344> candles</a>, and dabble in some <a href=https://www.instagram.com/dalia.jpeg/ > photography. </a> <br/> I am a chapter leader for <a href=https://www.girldevelopit.com/ >Girl Develop It- San Jose</a>, and an organizer for <a href=https://techqueria.org/ >Techqueria- Bay Area.</a> </p> </div> <div class=interests> <h1>Currently</h1> <p>Reading: Designing Interactions by Bill Moggridge</p> <p>Playing: Monument Valley 2</p> <p>Listening: Dise√±o Cha Cha Ch√° and DesignBetter.Co</p> </div> </div> <div class=holo-bar> </div> <div class=bottom-links> <a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/daliaicedo target=_blank> <div class="linkedin icon"></div> </a> <a href=http://www.github.com/technomoda target=_blank> <div class="github icon"></div> </a> <a href=http://www.codepen.io/technomoda target=_blank> <div class="codepen icon"></div> </a> <a href=http://www.dribbble.com/technomoda target=_blank> <div class="dribbble icon"></div> </a> </div> <div class=copyright> <a href=https://github.com/technomoda/latechnomoda target=_blank><h3>this site was made with <img class=tiny-heart src=/8bitheart.gif /> by Dalia and Kevin</h3></a> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js"></script></body> </html>
