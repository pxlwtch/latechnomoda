          My Life with Rosie is a documentary film that examines the relationship between Rosa Parks & Carolyn Williamson Green.

          As the graphics designer, I was first tasked with designing transition graphics used to develop the plot for sections in which there was not much footage. Later, I was asked to do lower thirds, and the film posters.

           The target audience for this film was young students in an educational setting. This documentary film aimed to enlighten and educate others on the life of Rosa Parks and Carolyn Green’s work with her.

            I created a style guide for Rosie, we chose to keep the colors monochromatic because most of the footage (sans the interviews) was in black and white. A cursive font that slightly resembled Rosa's signature was selected for titles and a classic serif font was used for everything else. We all worked remotely and it was on assignment basis-meaning we only worked when a new task was created. </br>
            The first graphics I made were transition graphics using images and text to indicate a new stage in Rosa Park’s life, which was usually read by the narrator.

        I was tasked with designing the lower thirds used throughout the documentary when introducing the speaker.</br>

        The last thing I designed for Rosie was the film’s movie poster, the three below were the mock ups I made.

            The hardest part about designing for My Life with Rosie was the lack of footage we were able to use. Most footage of Rosa Parks is under copyright, and we weren’t able to access it.

            My Life with Rose was such a cool opportunity, I had never imaged myself desiging on a film. I got to meet Rosa Parks’ family, and work with a remote team.
