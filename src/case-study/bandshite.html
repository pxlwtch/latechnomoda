          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p> Bandshite is a small online shop I created.  I've always been really crafty and enjoyed creating things. After having an Etsy shop dedicated to bracelets and necklaces I began to venture off into making things for something I was really passionate about: music. I started making pins for bands that I liked because it was a cool way to show my love and devotion for that band in a cool and punk rock way. In an incredible stroke of luck other people thought so too, and they not only started buying pins, they also suggested more for me to design.</p>

        <p>When I created the Bandshite logo, I went through a few items associated with music. I liked cassettes, and music notes,  but eventually I settled with a vinyl record because I wanted something that could be shrunk down to a favicon size and still be recognized. Most of my customers were also vinyl fanatics and I also had quite a record collection at the time. </p>
