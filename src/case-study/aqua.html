          Aqua is a game for iOS in which players shoot small rings into u shaped pool noodles inspired by the Tomy aqua arcades from the 80s/90s.

            This project was created for a weekend hackathon, our task was to make an iOS game using spritekit and Swift. Since this was week one of our Swift learning, the hardest part about making this game was making the game work.

          The Audience

          <p>
            Our audience was our cohort, and the judges, who were guest programmers who worked in tech. We were judged on various things implementation of spritekit, UI, game design, and presentation. Our personas were young 20-something year olds, people who would play games on their phone to pass the time such as Candy Crush.

          The Design Process

          <p>
            The task was to create a functioning game so we opted to make the game as simple as possible, users played against a timer, and each time a circle fell inside the us a point was tallied.

            As usual, time was a big constraint. This was a weekend hackathon and our team had pretty much been strangers before the hackathon so bad communication (and lack of) also had a negative role in our experience. Our research consisted of asking our cohort mates (who were also working on their hackathon project) what they thought about the game. There was really good suggestions that led to the final design.

          In Perspective

        <div class="description">
          <p>
          Aqua was successful! It placed us in second place, out of twelve, and we got to learn how to use Spritekit!
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
          We prioritized making the bubbles work a bit too much, in retrospective, that was time that would have been better put to use in other aspects such as the physics. Given more time we could have developed this into a much more exciting game, but it really played like the original.
