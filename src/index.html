          Hello! üåä
          <br />
          I‚Äôm Dalia,  I‚Äôm a designer from California. I enjoy being creative,  programming   üíª , music , and hanging out with my puppy, Moose üê∂.
          <br />
          <br />
          My design days begin in the age of MySpace‚Äî editing images and making MySpace Layouts.
          My skills then made the transition to tumblr, where I would make gifs and tumblr themes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward a few years, I began making pins inspired by some of my favorite bands and selling them on Etsy.
          To my surprise, they sold quite well. Soon, I realized I could be making more money by having a website outside of Etsy.
          That led to me making Bandshite.com, an online shop I managed along with a few employees,
          which was great, but as all good things must come to an end‚Äî that chapter of my life ended.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2014, I began to work as a full time graphic designer for a company named Beverly Furniture.
          During this time, I went back to school to finish my degree in Communication Studies. In school, I focused on the interaction of humans and technology, and set my career aspirations in the tech world.
          I moved to the Bay Area in 2016, and completed a bootcamp to learn coding.
          <br />
          <br />
          Most recently, I have been working as a design consultant and have partnered up with small businesses and non-profits.
          I am a chapter leader for <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It- San Jose</a>, and an organizer for <a href="https://techqueria.org/">Techqueria- Bay Area.</a>
