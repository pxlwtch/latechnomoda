          Hello! üåä
        </p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">
          I‚Äôm Dalia,  I‚Äôm a designer from California. I enjoy being creative,  programming   üíª, and hanging out with my puppy, Moose üê∂.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
          My design days begin in the age of MySpace‚Äî editing images and making MySpace Layouts. (I was interviewed by <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/latino-usa/505870410/the-tech-industry-s-leaky-pipeline"><i>NPR</i></a> because of it once!) My skills then made the transition to tumblr, where I would make gifs and tumblr themes.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
          I went through school as an undocumented immigrant (DREAMER), this meant I didn't receive financial aid to pay for school, and the scholarships I qualified for were very limited.
        </br></br>
          In order to pay for school, I started a small side business online, where I designed pins and tee shirts for indie bands. This is a longer story, you can read about soon. The big takeaway here is that this led to me getting a full-time job as a designer.

      <p class="about-paragraph">
          In 2013, I began to work as a full time graphic designer for a company named Beverly Furniture.
          During this time, I went back to school to finish my degree in Communication Studies. In school, I focused on the interaction of humans and technology, and set my career aspirations in the tech world.
          I moved to the Bay Area in 2016, and completed a bootcamp in 2017 to learn coding.

          Most recently, I have been working as a design consultant and have partnered up with small businesses and non-profits. In my free time, I like to make <a href="https://twitter.com/ihdalia/status/928025980056121344"> candles</a>, and dabble in some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dalia.jpeg/"> photography. </a>
