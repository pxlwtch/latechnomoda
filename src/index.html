        Hello! 🌊
        <br />
        I’m Dalia,  I’m a designer from California. I enjoy being creative,  programming   💻 , music , and hanging out with my puppy, Moose 🐶.
        <br />
        <br />
        My design days begin in the age of MySpace— editing images and making MySpace Layouts.
        My skills then made the somewhat logical transition to tumblr, where I would make gifs and tumblr themes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fast forward a few years, I began making pins inspired by some of my favorite bands and selling them on Etsy.
        To my surprise, they sold quite well. Soon, I realized I could be making more money by having a website outside of Etsy.
        That led to me making Bandshite.com, an online shop I managed along with a few employees,
        which was great, but all good things must come to an end, and thus that chapter of my life ended.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2014, I began to work as a full time graphic designer for a small company, named Beverly Furniture.
        During this time, I went back to school to finish my degree in Communication Studies. I focused on the interaction of humans and technology, and set my aspirations in the tech world.  
        I moved to the Bay Area in 2016, and completed a bootcamp to learn coding.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most recently, I have been working as a design consultant and have partnered up with small businesses and non-profits.
        I am a chapter leader for <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It- San Jose</a>, and an organizer for <a href="https://techqueria.org/">Techqueria- Bay Area.</a>
